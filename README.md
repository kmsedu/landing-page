# The Odin Project Landing Page Project

The goal of this project is to recreate a layout using HTML and CSS from an image as well as a design documenting detailing the basics of the colors and fonts used.

I tried to utilize only flexboxes for positioning the layout as this has been the main topic throughout the previous few lessons.
